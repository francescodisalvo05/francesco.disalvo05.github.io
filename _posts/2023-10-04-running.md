We all know that engaging in sports is beneficial for our health. Our parents emphasized this when we were young, and today, productivity gurus continue to advocate for that early morning jog, preferably at 4:00 am.

Personally, I have been doing sports during my whole life, with more or less severe on-off periods. Recently, I've been running consistently, and I've been enjoying it so far. However, in the last couple of weeks I had some rough time at work and zero motivation to run. 
Despite that, I pushed myself to step out for a quick and casual run, only to end up covering a 10k and improving my timings. Not bad, right? It happened not once but twice, teaching me a valuable lesson — sometimes, all you need to do is show up!

Surrounded by a constant stream of stimuli, running offers me a perfect opportunity to be alone with my thoughts, even though I occasionally get interrupted by coach Anita (from the Nike Run App), who diligently updates me on my pace. Also, post-run, I find myself energized and motivated for the tasks that lie ahead. To me, this still remains counterintuitive yet incredibly fascinating.

Despite these relatively small short-term benefits, today, I was curious to delve into the scientific literature to learn more about the subtle benefits that are harder to observe firsthand.

## Mental health

I stumbled upon an extensive scoping review (Oswald, F., et al., 2020) that summarized the findings from 116 papers. These studies, conducted under different experimental settings, unanimously agree that both casual and professional running improve mental health. Specifically, they evaluated traits like anxiety, depression, stress, and mood.

Here are some noteworthy findings extracted from the paper and its related sources:

* Females jogging with greater intensity had significantly less anxiety than those jogging at lower intensities [38].
* Two studies found that a single outdoor run significantly improved depression scores and that even a 10-min jog caused significant mood enhancement [80,94].
* Seven studies found that markers of mental health improved significantly after running [101-107].
* One study found that, while two indoor runs had a positive effect on mood, the outdoor run had an even greater benefit to mood with subjects feeling less anxious, depressed, hostile and fatigued and feeling more invigorated [109].
* Another study also used 3 runs of varying intensities and found significant overall mood benefits postexercise but no significant differences between intensities [110].

## Cardiovascular Mortality Risk

(Lee, D. C., et al.,) conducted a study on 55,137 adults (with a mean age of 44 years) that revealed runners, compared to non-runners, had a 30% and 45% lower risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively. Overall, non-runners had a life expectancy that was 3 years shorter compared to runners, even after adjusting for other mortality predictors.

Another intriguing result was that these lower risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality remained consistent across all weekly running time quantiles, including the lowest quantile (less than 51 minutes per week), which corresponds to an average of 7 minutes per day.

Equally insightful, these benefits among runners did not significantly differ between different weekly running quantiles.

Despite the mentioned limitations regarding population diversity and data acquisition, this study provided strong evidence about the benefits of running.

Now, I'm eagerly looking forward to my next run!
