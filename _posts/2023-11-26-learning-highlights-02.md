Hello there!

This month has been pretty intense as I went through **my first academic deadline** for a conference. For better or for worse, like many PhD students in my position, I didn't set aside much free time for exploring things beyond my research. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the entire process and learned a lot. I feel more prepared for the next one, and I'm sure I will be able to optimizing my time and workflow.

Before going to bed, I tried to strike a balance between reading, chilling, and squeezing in some extra learning. Here are a few things I would like to share.

## [Three Things I've Learned About Bayes' Rule](https://markxu.com/three-bayes-learnings){:target="_blank"}, Mark Xu

**TL;DR**: Bayes' Rule reminds us that every action provides evidence about our abilities (**update multiple hypothesis**). Extraordinary evidence isn't as uncommon as we might believe (**strong evidence**). Individual evidences can lead to overconfidence, but considering them together reveals a more nuanced picture, highlighting the importance of **conditioning**.

Quick but beautiful read. Mark Xu explores three practical examples of how we unconsciously rely on the Bayes' reasoning in our daily lives.

**TL;DR**: countries with **stronger economic growth** rate often show historical **lower stock market returns**, compared to Emerging Markets (EM). However, EM tend **undergo liberalization**, their expected **returns should decline**, reflecting a subsequent lower cost of capital. 
Regarding the distribution of returns, EM exhibits more severe **negative skewness** than developed markets, along with a **negative co-skewness** with the MSCI world index.

Another gem from Ben Felix. Considering that my World ETF ([SUSW](https://www.justetf.com/it/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BYX2JD69)) does not include Emerging Markets, I was thinking to include them in my portfolio through a second ETF ([EIMI](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BKM4GZ66#chart)). While I'm still in the process of researching before making a final decision, this video provided a valuable initial understanding of the situation!

He highlights that developed Markets are [negativelly skewed](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data-science/negatively-skewed-distribution/), indicating that **returns are generally more positive than negative**, with **infrequent extreme negative returns**. The encouraging aspect is that **Emerging Markets** (EM) exhibit an even **more severe negative skewness**. Furthermore, EM has a **negative co-skewness with the MSCI world index**. Consequently, including both in our portfolio makes our overall skewness more negative. However, the downside is that the **disaster risks of EM are higher** than those of developed markets, potentially making recovery from substantial losses more challenging.

**TL;DR**: Coffee, always depicted as a dangerous substance, offers more benefits than issues, with moderation being the key. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends a maximum daily dose of 400mg of caffeine, equivalent to 4/5 espresso cups. Additionally, [this paper](https://www.bmj.com/content/359/bmj.j5024) highlights various health benefits associated with coffee consumption.

Giacomo (the author of the video), explains the **physiological effects of caffeine** on the body. Shortly, caffeine acts as an **antagonist to adenosine**, a compound our body produces during waking hours, and whose accumulation leads to the perception of **fatigue**. Caffeine, having a similar structure to adenosine, occupies its receptors, **reducing feelings of tiredness** and **increasing alertness**.

> This is also well explored in Matthew Walker's book, "Why We Sleep". His explanation of caffeine's persistence in the body led me to stop having coffee after dinner. In fact, caffeine, if consumed before bedtime, doesn't have enough time to be eliminated, disrupting the natural ejection of adenosine and potentially hindering a restful night's sleep.

**TL;DR**: While Dollar Cost Averaging remains a safe choice for accumulating ETFs, considering the monthly **market volatility** might lead to a more nuanced approach. 

**Dollar Cost Averaging** (DCA) involves investing a **fixed amount monthly**. This allows to buy slightly more stocks while market downturns and slightly less stocks while the market goes up. Conversely, a **Value Averaging** (VA) strategy define the **monthly value increase of the portfolio**, which is subject to the current and previous porfolio values. 

> Assume a desired monthly increase of 1000 euros. If your portfolio goes up by 700 euros (because of the market), invest 300 euros. If it goes down by 500 euros, invest 1500 euros.

This strategy is quite appealing to me, but I would like to **modify** it based on my view and financial plans. Specifically, since the **market is typically bullish** in the **long-term**, I think we might loose significant long term profits if we invest much less or even worse, we have to sell. 

> Considering the previous experiment, if the portfolio grows by 1500 euros, we should sell 500 euros of stocks. 

While talking to a friend (S.R.), we both agreed on this view, and we are currently thinking about setting a **"minimum" investment**, regardless of market movements, in order to not lose long-term profits. The specific percentage for this minimum investment is still under consideration. We planned to have fun with some spreadsheets or Monte Carlo simulations. Let's see how it turns out!
