Another year has passed, filled with experiences that call for reflection. I achieved most of my major goals, but as the new year approaches, I want to slightly change my mindset: I'm going to aim for *less commitment and more enjoyment*. I've always challenged myself, often quantitatively, which sometimes transforms these challenges into tasks rather than pure enjoyment. I'm not abandoning my challenges, but I plan to approach them with less pressure, allowing myself to go with the flow more.

## Professional
My PhD journey has been **fulfilling**, exceeding my high expectations. It's been a great experience, both academically and personally. The process of **submitting my first paper** was intense yet immensely rewarding, motivating me to strive for the next milestones. Additionally, an unexpected joy has been **supervising motivated students** - guiding them and watching them grow is incredibly satisfying as well.

In 2024, I aim to start **engaging with the research community**.  Hopefully, I will attend the first conferences, but besides that, I would love to start building meaningful connections with some other enthusiast researchers. Participating in a summer school or getting involved with communities like [ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org/) or [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/) are some ideas on my radar.

## Personal 
From La Spezia (Italy), **I moved** to Bamberg, a small yet lovely city in Germany. Besides the whole paperwork (that I am still figuring out to some extent), moving to another country was not that hard overall. However, it was harder than my previous experience in The Netherlands. Back then, trying to connect with other international students was much easier.

I started and stopped learning **German** twice. Although I recognize its benefits for integration, I never considered it as a high priority. On the flip side, I really enjoyed **running** along the river, and I managed to reach a good pace on both 5k and 10k routes. I temporarily stopped during these cold and dark days, but I recently discovered the joy of **drawing**. Starting from some drawing lessons, I am now fascinated by the idea of drawing portraits or urban sketches. I am looking forward to seeing where it goes!

As I keep my spirit of self-challenge, my goals for this year include running a half marathon and drawing a portrait of my girlfriend that I'm proud of. And German? Well, studying for an A1/A2 certificate would be definitely a plus.
