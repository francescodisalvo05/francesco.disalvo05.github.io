    Hi, I am Francesco! 

    <br  /><br  />

    I am Francesco, a first-year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/ai/chair-of-explainable-machine-learning/">Otto-Friedrich University of Bamberg</a>, 
    under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.christianledig.com/">Christian Ledig</a>. I am currently working on harnessing the power of foundation 
    models for optimal utilization in downstream tasks, with a strong emphasis on efficiency, explainability and, robustness.

    <br  /><br  />

    Previously, I worked on <a href="assets/pdf/SummaryMScThesis.pdf" target="_blank">Bayesian uncertainty on dedicated breast-CT scans</a> 
    at the <a href="http://axti.radboudimaging.nl/index.php/Home">Advanced X-ray Tomographic Imaging lab</a>, under the supervision of
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C6l5Es8AAAAJ&hl=en">Marco Caballo</a>.

    <br  /><br  />

    Finally, I also interned at <a href="https://www.sto.nato.int/">NATO</a> and <a href="https://aikospace.com/">AIKO</a>, 
    where I worked on anomaly detection on underwater communications and visual odometry on planetary-like environments, respectively.

    <br  /><br  />

    This blog is still <a href="/writing.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.953)">under construction</a>, stay tuned!

    </p>
