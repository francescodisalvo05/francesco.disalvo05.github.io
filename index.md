Ciao, I am Francesco!

I am a first-year PhD student at the [Otto-Friedrich University of Bamberg][uni-bamberg], under the supervision of Professor [Christian Ledig][cl]. I am currently working on harnessing the power of foundation models for optimal utilization in downstream tasks, with a strong emphasis on efficiency, explainability and, robustness.

Previously, I worked on [Bayesian uncertainty on dedicated breast-CT scans][thesis] at the [Advanced X-ray Tomographic Imaging lab][axti], under the supervision of [Marco Caballo][mc] and [Filippo Molinari][fm].

Finally, I also interned at [NATO][nato] and [AIKO][aiko], where I worked on anomaly detection on underwater communications and visual odometry on planetary-like environments, respectively.
