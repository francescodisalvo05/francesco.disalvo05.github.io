I'm a product of my input: the books I read, the blogs I follow, and the shows I watch. To give you a glimpse into my world, here is a non-exhaustive list!

## Books

I started reading seriously in 2020, thanks to a yearly reading goal. Since then, I've read more and more books, with some on-off periods.
I've primarily been reading non-fiction books, but I recently got into sci-fi thanks to Dark Matter and The Martian! Below there are my top 3 books in each genre. 

> Full list of books [here](./books). I'm always looking for new books to read, so please share your favorites with me!

Some evenings, I like to find inspiration on the web by reading long-form essays from my favorite blogs.

## YouTube

During high school, I was a big fan of Netflix series, and my top three favorites of all time are Sherlock, Peaky Blinders, and Vikings. However, since I started university, I've almost stopped watching them. YouTube has become my main source of video entertainment, and I enjoy watching videos about finance, traveling, and science while I'm cooking or eating.
