**TL;DR**: countries with **stronger economic growth** rate often show historical **lower stock market returns**, compared to Emerging Markets (EM). However, EM tend **undergo liberalization**, their expected **returns should decline**, reflecting a subsequent lower cost of capital. 
Regarding the distribution of returns, EM exhibits more severe **negative skewness** than developed markets, along with a **negative co-skewness** with the MSCI world index.

Another gem from Ben Felix. Considering that my World ETF ([SUSW](https://www.justetf.com/it/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BYX2JD69)) does not include Emerging Markets, I was thinking to include them in my portfolio through a second ETF ([EIMI](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?isin=IE00BKM4GZ66#chart)). While I'm still in the process of researching before making a final decision, this video provided a valuable initial understanding of the situation!

He highlights that developed Markets are [negativelly skewed](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data-science/negatively-skewed-distribution/), indicating that **returns are generally more positive than negative**, with **infrequent extreme negative returns**. The encouraging aspect is that **Emerging Markets** (EM) exhibit an even **more severe negative skewness**. Furthermore, EM has a **negative co-skewness with the MSCI world index**. Consequently, including both in our portfolio makes our overall skewness more negative. However, the downside is that the **disaster risks of EM are higher** than those of developed markets, potentially making recovery from substantial losses more challenging.
