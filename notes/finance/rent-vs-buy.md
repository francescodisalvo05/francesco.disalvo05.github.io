**TL;DR**: while renting might seem like a waste of money, **buying** a house **comes with** significant **unrecoverable costs** as well. According to Ben Felix (and his geographical bias), this accounts for a **yearly 5%** of the property value, that includes:

* 1% for **property taxes**
* 1% for **maintenance costs**
* 3% for the **cost of capital**

Thus, if you can find an **annual rent that's lower than 5%** of the hypothetical budget you'd use to buy a house, renting may actually be a **more financially efficient** choice.

The **cost of capital** reflects the gap between the expected returns in the stock market versus the housing market. Therefore, it is **highly subjective** and it is closely tied to the **opportunity cost**. Can you invest in the stock market and earn those returns? If your alternative would be to hide the money under the mattress, buying might be a more appealing option!

This reminds me the [**"list of countries by home-ownership rate"**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/246355/home-ownership-rate-in-europe/){:target="_blank"}. Could it be **related to financial literacy**? I can speak for Italy (ownership of 73.7% in 2021), where [financial literacy is quite low](https://www.bancaditalia.it/statistiche/tematiche/indagini-famiglie-imprese/alfabetizzazione/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1){:target="_blank"}, and most people still firmly believe in the "high power of the brick"...
